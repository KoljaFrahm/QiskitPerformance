The file "x_data_bkg_8features.npy" has to be added manually to the QML-HEP-data/ directory.

The dataset has 3502425 events in the train dataset and 194580 in the test and validation dataset. If you want to reduce the dataset, you use line 152ff. and specify the number of events you want to have in each dataset with adjusting num_samples.
